a). This project I coded 2 seperate programs, I created a Multi Threaded Server and a simple javaFx Client application to go along with it. Upon first launch of the client the user is prompted to select a directory which will be used as the local location for the file share and then the program will create a config that stores the directory of the file share. If it is not the users first time opening the program then the user is brought right to the menu where they can enter the ip and port they want to connect to then can connect to the file share server. Once connected to the server they can refreh the file lists, download any file from the server or upload any file from their local directory.

b). I made it so any file could be transfered so its not just limited to .txt files, I also added a menu and the ability to choose which port and ip you would like to connect to, and finally I added a refresh button to manually refresh the view

c). To successfully clone and run my code, just copy the source files into Intellij and run the server then main
